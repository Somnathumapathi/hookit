Hookit 

Hookit is an ETL-based workflow automation platform designed to simplify data onboarding and real-time integration. It enables users to parse and transform data formats (e.g., CSV to SQL/NoSQL) directly into their databases via webhooks, with workflows defined in an intuitive UI.  

## Features  
- **Data Parsing and Transformation**: Convert CSV or other formats into SQL/NoSQL or any other databases specified in workflow seamlessly.  
- **Workflow Automation**: Define workflows for data ingestion, filtering, and updates with ease.  
- **Campaign Form Data Integration**: Automate handling of form data, such as Facebook Lead Ads.  
- **No-Code Tools**: Empower non-developers with iframe widgets for quick triggers.  
- **Developer Flexibility**: Enable advanced workflow customization and real-time sync with webhooks.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: T3 Stack (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS).  
- **Backend**: Go with GoFr framework for high-performance API handling.  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for structured data; NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for unstructured data.  
- **Notifications**: Firebase for real-time updates.  
- **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay for subscription and credits.  

## How It Works  
1. Upload data (e.g., CSV) to the provided webhook.  
2. Define workflows in the UI with filters and credentials.  
3. Automate data ingestion, transformation, and updates into the target database.

## Use Cases  
- Onboard legacy data stored in different formats.  
- Automate customer form data ingestion (e.g., Facebook Lead Ads).  
- Schedule recurring data workflows with cron jobs.
